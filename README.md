# **Bot Setup and Usage Guide**  

ðŸ‘‹ **Hey!** I made this bot for a server called **LSCRP**, but unfortunately, they kicked me out and were really rude, taking away my staff role after I helped them with everything. I decided to share this bot with everyone so it doesnâ€™t go to waste and can still be useful to others!
